Hello world!

Jean here.  I am a designer/entrepreneur turned techie.  My undergrad was in design because design thinking transcends all subject matters, no matter what field you choose to pursue.  I've always loved technology, the modern pioneering frontier of our time.  I learned a bit of Java while getting a CS minor, and threw myself into the fire of Product Management at the immersive program at General Assembly.  I currently work at DivvyCloud, a tech startup based in Arlington, VA that specializes in event-driven automations, across a unified multi-cloud world.
